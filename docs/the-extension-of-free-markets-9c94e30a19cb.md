古典经济学家强调不同种类的资源是稀缺的，这意味着我们没有足够的资源来生产任何人都想要的所有商品和服务。这意味着，作为一个社会，我们必须能够评估哪些资源将用于生产哪些商品和服务。将资源提供给用户就是分配资源。我们更喜欢组织事情，以便资源被用于最重要和最有益的生产，换句话说，我们喜欢有效地分配资源。

**新古典主义经济学流派**将市场体系的功能及其作为资源配置者的作用认定为经济应该关注的问题。这个学派的经济学家分析了决定有效市场及其利益的条件。一个好处是资源的分配，最好是私有的，在价格机制的帮助下，通过具有理想条件的市场最有效地满足人类的需求。根据新古典主义理论，公民的所有需求都可以通过商品和服务的消费来满足。顾客根据他们的口味购买，公司生产目前最有利可图的商品。经济主体(买方或卖方)做出的这些选择导致了商品和服务的均衡生产。每个代理人都遵循自己的利益，而不考虑行动的后果。微观经济学通过关注系统中小单位的行为来解释经济的运作，成为经济系统新古典分析的核心(Barber，2003)。

照此看来，价格成了整个微观经济关系网络的关键。Friedman (2003)简化了新古典价格理论，指出价格系统是一种机制，在这种机制中，双方出于自身利益的动机自愿交换，没有中央指导。这种机制确保了市场效率，协调了所有代理人的行动，并有助于塑造他们的决策和价格设置。除了传递决定价格设定的信息——基于供求力量——价格体系还促使人们采用成本最低的生产方式，将资源用于最有价值的目的。一旦收入被确定为“销售商品和服务所得与生产这些商品和服务所发生的成本之间的差额”(2003:129)，价格在收入分配中也起着核心作用。

这个由价格体系支配的市场被认为在一个仅由供求等市场力量调节的经济中实现了其全部潜力(Marshall，2003)。企业之间的竞争有望在自由市场中自我调节商品和服务的价格和质量。促进经济增长的最有效方式是通过一个政府干预和监管最少的市场，形成一个竞争性的市场体系。新古典经济学家相信自我调节的市场经济，在这种经济中，自由市场带来资源的有效配置。这种有效的分配是自由市场的最大好处。在这些或多或少罕见的情况下，当市场无法实现平衡时，政府应该尽可能进行干预以纠正这种情况。

政府管制和干预最少的市场体系创造了自由贸易发生的理想条件，导致更多的贸易，更多的贸易导致更多的增长(Hamilton，2003)，这种增长导致进步，一旦新古典学派的经济学家认为公民的所有需求都可以通过商品和服务的消费得到满足，这将解决社会紧张局势。自由市场不仅被视为经济进步的关键，而且基本上成为一种整合的工具，因为它能够以对社会最有利的方式分配资源(Barber，2003)。

新古典模式在过去几十年中赢得了越来越多的支持，为了实现理想的自由市场条件，政府面临着消除经济中各种监管制度的巨大压力，如国家垄断和金融监管(Anderson，2003)。前者将为消费者带来更多的选择和更低的价格，后者将产生更多的资金，所有这些都是为了建立一个更具竞争性的市场，从而给经济和社会带来好处。随着市场放松管制，企业推动政府减少工人的权利，因为工人的权利被视为市场效率的障碍。这导致澳大利亚等国家放松了对劳动力市场的管制(Anderson，2003)。

Institutionalists perceive that the restructuring of the relations between employers and employees have consistently attacked the traditional protections that were provided to workers, since this restructuring usually conflicts with worker’s rights. In order to achieve the level of competitiveness claimed by corporations and neo-liberal economists, governments have restricted and reduced traditional protections once provided to labor (Anderson, 2003). Labor rights have been dragged to the lowest denominator possible as a way to improve the competitiveness of corporations in a global market. The practical result has not only been lower wages but also the loss of rights regarding issues such as unionization and work hours. Workers have faced the growth of part-time jobs with lesser fringe benefits and a great loss of collective bargain power. A low-wage process has been employed by companies as a means to achieve larger margins of profit, resulting in lower levels of welfare and employability.

Meantime, the market deregulation claimed by neo-classical economists as a means to promote competitive market systems — which would lead to efficiency and profit, profit that would fund future investments and economic growth; growth which would provide employment and distribution of income and consumer benefit — has actually led to private monopoly and oligopoly over profitable economic sectors and limited consumer benefits. In reality free markets have generated a destructive “race to the bottom” in which all involved try to amass the most capital and resources at the expense of everyone else. According to Tim Anderson (2003) deregulation of markets and social relations has actually been designed to favor employers and managers, over citizens and workers. The State’s main aim has been to protect the profitability of key, private corporations.

While the poor and middle classes are subjected to market supply and demand, the upper classes are eternally given a helping hand by the State, which instead of representing the social rights of the common people, acts as the guardian of power and privilege, a long time on the hands of the few wealthy ones. It is common and most times expected that the costs of big business will be socialized via tax subsidies while profits are privatised.

For institutionalists, the free market model that has been defended by neo-liberal governments has actually disconnected social and economic development from needed goods and services and given way to oligopolies of multinational corporations. Unregulated free market, on the average, makes people with power have more power through the exercise of their power. Governments have become the instrument of the few and powerful corporations and wealthy people. The free market has caused the concentration of power in multinational corporations, causing the widening gap between the rich and the poor, promoting sharper economic inequality. Moreover, Stilwell (2003) states that economic inequality is the product of the imperialistic status of corporations and the greater exploitation of labor intensified under the neo-classical economic model.

As a result, societies are facing greater social problems with little perspective on changes and support from the government, once governments become less committed to social development and more committed to providing profitable markets to corporations. More poverty and violence, even in rich countries, reflect that. According to Stilwell (2003), even from an environmental perspective, economic inequality is also problematic. Environmental degradation, which directly affects quality of life, has been intensified in order to achieve market competitiveness. Governments have been pushed, and many times have accepted, to reduce environmental standards as a way to lower production cost and generate more market efficiency.

The consequences of the economic inequality intensified by free markets go beyond. For institutionalists, they not only produce social conflict and environmental degradation, it consistently affects productivity itself. Veblen (2003) clearly shows his concern regarding the issue by analyzing the role of property as the exponent of success. He states that property became the most easily recognized evidence of a reputable degree of success. It, therefore, became the conventional basis of esteem. To accumulate, to acquire property became indispensable to have a good reputation. In a context in which people have lower possibilities of better earnings and hardly any perspective in acquiring property, there is no motivation to produce; once to produce more does not necessarily mean a better life. Moreover, Stilwell states that “economic inequality exacerbates class conflict. That tends to undermine the necessary conditions for economic efficiency. Violating equity endangers efficiency” (2003:27).

For institutionalists the implications of a government more committed to “market efficiency” and less committed to social development have worse effects in an economy driven by knowledge and skill. Knowledge and skills are usually acquired and developed through the provision of good education, exactly one social service that governments have been drafting away from and failing to provide with quality. Hamilton (2003) clearly shows his concerns regarding this issue when he states that once it is accepted that know-how is more important in the modern economy than physical capital and low-cost labor then, instead of reinforcing trade liberalisation as means to set off a growth process, governments should concentrate on promoting education and innovation.

Free trade across free markets has been claimed by neo-classical economists as a means of promoting greater mobilization of capital and labor, which would lead to more productivity, profit, new investments, employment, economic growth, social development. In contrast, Institutionalists perceive that the current free trade model is actually building up an industrial structure which retains some countries to a position of natural resource and unskilled labor supplier, and multinational corporations concentrating higher-level knowledge that drives economical growth and profit in a global economy (Hamilton, 2003). This profit generated by corporations within operations in countries that hold physical capital and raw labor power is most commonly sent to the corporations’ home country or invested in more profitable market operations around the world. So the claim that opening markets would lead to more investments and employment in the micro-economy is not totally true.

Towards a more holistic model which does not exclusively focus on the micro relations of the market system, and that may satisfy the needs of citizens, institutionalists emphasize the role of extensive macroeconomics settings in a dynamic global economy so as to achieve consistent growth and reduce social conflict.

**The Institutional school of political economy** focus on social conflict and institutional change over time to analyse the economic system contrasting the social balance and equilibrium emphasis from neo-classical economics (Elliot, 2003). According to this school markets are created through state intervention and historical evolution. Instead of taking market efficiency as the engine that propels prosperity, institutional theory highlights the importance of satisfying the needs of people and how these needs are socially constructed. Therefore, an evolutionary perspective on the concept of citizenship is of the interest of this school in order to analyse social conflict. Neo-classical theory is based on the late 18th century civil rights concept of citizenship, which became the basis of liberalism. It perceives citizenship based on the civil rights to freedom — freedom of speech, movement, assembling, entering voluntary contract, owning property and the freedom to public jury –, explaining its focus on market efficiency. On the other hand, institutionalists base their beliefs on the social rights concept of citizenship. Citizenship is analysed through the concept that focuses on the rights to respectable living standards, such as good education, housing and health care. Therefore, it requires State intervention for its provision.

Furthermore, institutionalism theory identifies evolutionary change in economic institutions caused by technological change. Technology is seen as decisive, it is the key to the development process since the “inter connections between technology and institutions are perceived to constitute the dynamics of development” (2003:150). According to John E. Elliot, modern technology has increased the scale of economic activity and created opportunities for corporations to control markets, “advancing technology stimulated the rise of the corporation to a position of economic dominance” (2003:151). Due to this fact the State is required to intervene to prevent social disorganization and exploitation. Institutionalist economics emphasizes the complex and changing relation between economic and social institutions focusing on ways in which problems such as unemployment can be solved through social policy. Institutionalism rejects the natural laws of motion of neo-classicism — as described by Adam Smith as an “invisible hand” that coordinates actions of economic agents driven by self-interest to the good of everyone, without people’s knowledge and intervention. Institutional economics sees a world that is and has ever been created and recreated by humans who are always molded by social circumstance and institutions.

The main role of government is to act as guardian of social rights, bringing about equilibrium between the goals of economic institutions and the needs of common people. In situations where corporate practices conflict with social development, the State has the role to intervene and create conditions through which the interests of the population as a whole can be guaranteed in a constantly changing economy.

The extensive development and application of information and communications technologies (ICTs), along with growing investments in the process of innovation and discovery for new products and services in the last decades has led to an up-skilling of the workforce across various sectors creating the basis of what is known by knowledge-based economy (OECD, 1996). According to the institutional theory this new context dramatically changed the relations in economy, which became less machine-intensive and more knowledge-intensive. It means that the capacity to produce became even more dependent on innovation and education requiring government intervention to provide such inputs.

新熊彼特经济学强调创新和技术变革是实现经济增长的手段。新古典经济学的均衡理论没有认识到经济增长背后的创新和技术变革，与之相反，新熊彼特经济学侧重于创新，而不是竞争性市场体系(Phillimore，2003)。新熊彼特经济学认为竞争对这一过程至关重要，但企业家之间的竞争旨在获得垄断利润。创新和技术变革被认为至少暂时确保了垄断利润。NSE 强调政府对研发的支持，因为这对学习能力很重要。NSE 政策基于“学习和创新，而不是新古典主义强调纠正市场失灵和促进市场效率”(2003:317)。一旦在研发上的投资需要很长时间才能得到回报，企业对眼前的利润感兴趣，政府就需要进行投资来促进创新。创新投资，而不是低工资，被认为能引导企业获得更多利润。

根据 Thurow (1997)的观点，在现代经济中知识和技能(人力资本)是比较优势的来源。如今，决定效率和带来经济活动的是一个公司拥有的人力资本。人力资本成为生产中的主导因素。

> 因为每个人都从相同的全球供应商那里购买相同的设备，所以能够给公司带来竞争优势的技术并不存在于竞争对手买不起的独特设备中，而是存在于公司员工的头脑中，他们知道如何以独特和增强的方式使用该设备(Thurow，1997:280)。

不仅以设备的形式，而且以知识的形式考虑技术，这成为开发过程的关键。制度和技术之间的相互联系被视为构成发展的动力，成为制度政治经济学的主要关注点(Elliot，2003)。为了在知识经济时代实现社会发展和经济增长，各国政府必须创造条件，使国内经济能够应对信息社会的新需求。对于制度主义者来说，国家需要投资于促进技术创新和建设人力资本的机构，特别是通过 R&D 和优质教育，这不仅是富人——在大多数情况下都是如此——而且最重要的是穷人——可以获得，作为促进经济和社会平等的一种手段。政府还需要提供能够支持信息社会新需求的基础设施，如电信系统。通过这样做，国家为国内市场的真正竞争力创造了理想的条件。

在全球经济中，通信技术和快速运输使得从全球任何地方的生产点进入和服务市场成为可能。

> 人造智能工业可以位于地球表面的任何地方。它们将位于何处取决于谁组织脑力来捕捉它们(Thurow，1997:67)。

因此，政府有责任创造条件吸引专注于技术创新的跨国公司，并提供高薪就业。

一旦现代技术增加了经济活动的规模，为企业创造了控制市场的机会(Elliot，2003)，跨国公司就在经济过程中扮演了核心角色。像公司将在哪里发展和保持技术领先地位这样的决定，是大多数高薪工作将在哪里的决定因素。跨国公司的高薪领导技能将位于开发这些技术领导技能的成本最低的地方。

> 向企业提供发展技术领先地位的最低成本的国家将是在研发、教育和开发领导地位所必需的基础设施方面投资最多的国家，国家财富将流向那些建立了相互加强的技能组合的国家(Thurow，1997:75)。

与此同时，呼吁政府通过监管制度干预经济，以确保投资于知识、研究和技术发展的利益留在国内经济中。此外，政府应该改变贸易规则，允许禁止不符合基本劳工标准的进口，防止企业从低于标准的做法中获益。朝着这种变化的行动可以使国际贸易成为改善世界劳工和环境标准的机制(Hamilton，2003)。随着国家更多地充当社会利益的监护者，并促进不同经济主体之间的平衡，社会有更多的机会实现更好的生活水平。随着时间的推移，制度经济学关注社会冲突和制度变迁以决定经济增长，它将自由市场的扩展视为一种机制，这种机制除了最多产生少量短期利益外，还会带来社会不稳定和经济不平等。一旦自由市场违背国家必须保障的公民社会权利，它就被视为反民主的。由于本文已经讨论过的原因，自由市场的扩展对进步和社会发展的条件产生了负面影响，没有兑现其繁荣的承诺。在一个“人造智能”产业的时代，政府代表整个社会的利益并促进经济和社会平等的作用对于实现持续、长期的繁荣至关重要。只有以这种方式行事，公民的需求才更有可能得到满足。
