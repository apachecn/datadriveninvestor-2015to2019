The president of China is urging companies and government institutes to start embracing blockchain technology. President Xi Jinping sees blockchain technology as a core for innovation. He made [these comments](http://www.xinhuanet.com/2019-10/25/c_1125153665.htm) at a meeting of the Politburo Committee on Thursday.

According to Xi Jinping, the implementation and adoption of blockchain technology are key in the transformation of industries and innovation of technology. He pointed to use-cases in the financial business, mass transit and combating poverty.

> “We must take the blockchain as an important breakthrough for independent innovation of core technologies. We must clarify the main direction, increase investment, focus on a number of key core technologies, and accelerate the development of blockchain technology and industrial innovation.”

> President Xi Jinping of China — translated by [Coindesk](https://www.coindesk.com/president-xi-says-china-should-seize-opportunity-to-adopt-blockchain), reported by [XinhuaNet](http://www.xinhuanet.com/2019-10/25/c_1125153665.htm) (Oct 25th 2019)

This marks the first time that the president of China has in-depth remarks on blockchain technology. He also added that laws should be adjusted or created to embrace these technological innovations.

Since 2017 it’s illegal to run cryptocurrency exchanges. However, the Chinese government is working on a [Central Bank Digital Currency](https://www.nederob.nl/?s=central+bank+digital+currency). When this [digital yuan](https://www.nederob.nl/2019/08/28/china-cryptocurrency-coming-in-november/) will be available is still a bit unclear. In July a court [declared bitcoin to be a virtual property](https://www.nederob.nl/2019/07/24/bitcoin-legally-protected-property-in-china/). As a result, this meant that cryptocurrencies are protected by law.

## China Telecom already working on it

Even though the Chinese president just now started talking about blockchain, technology companies have been active for years. Recently China Telecom released a whitepaper in which they described the future of mobile telephones. Each phone would be contributing to a decentralized network, while allowing for example digital identity verification, supply chain tracing services, and express delivery services.

In the first place, China Telecom wants to build a blockchain application system. This system combats fraud, harassment, loss of data and crimes related to identity theft. Secondly, they plan a digital assets management system build into a SIM card.

## 政府开始使用区块链

在世界各地，都有政府实施区块链技术的例子。例如，在马尔他，政府将租赁合同放在区块链上以打击欺诈。此外，土耳其将使用区块链[注册学历文凭和土地所有权](https://www.nederob.nl/2019/09/19/turkish-government-to-use-blockchain-for-administration/)。最后一个例子是南韩，南韩政府希望将 T4 所有的贸易业务放在区块链 T5。这将削减 90%的成本。

在其他国家,[法律框架](https://www.nederob.nl/2019/10/08/blockchain-act-unanimously-accepted-in-liechtenstein/)和[引进 CBDC 的](https://www.nederob.nl/2019/10/09/switzerland-announces-central-bank-digital-currency/)都有助于区块链技术的采用。在圣马力诺，他们甚至宣布了一个奖励系统，绿色公民可以获得加密奖金。
