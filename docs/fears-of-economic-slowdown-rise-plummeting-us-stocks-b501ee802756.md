United States and China both agreed over the weekend to cease on the additional tariffs on each other’s goods, and allowing trade talks to continue. The meeting of the two countries made stocks surge on Monday. Even with the intense match over trade between the two countries, Trump administration slapping a heavy $250 billion worth tariffs on Chinese imports, and Chinese Presidents Xi Jinping’s government has imposed $110 billion of tariffs on US goods.

Trump sends a series of tweets saying that the deal will be done if it is possible but also says, “But if not possible remember … I am a Tariff man.”
