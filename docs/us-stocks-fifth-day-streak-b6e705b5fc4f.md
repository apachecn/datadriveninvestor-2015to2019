Stock indexes rose on Thursday, but some share prices were disappointing, such as Macy’s and American Airline falls. There is also a continuous lingering fear of the weight that the partial government shutdown would cause on US stocks.

S&P 500 advanced 0.42 percent to 2,596.64 recording its fifth day win. Dow Jones also posted a five-day winning streak. The Dow rose 0.51 percent to 24,001.92 due to Boeing overperforming. The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.42 percent to 6,986.07.

Meeting from China and the US ended in three days. Many extensive negotiations are taking place and it has helped build a lead for further talks. This week was the first face to face meeting to take place since Donald Trump and Xi Jinping agreed to the 90-day truce. It is also said that if both countries don’t reach an agreement by March 2 Trump will raise tariffs to 25 percent from 10 percent worth about $200 billion worth on Chinese imports.
